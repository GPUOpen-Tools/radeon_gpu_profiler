# Radeon™ GPU Profiler

The Radeon GPU Profiler (RGP) is a ground-breaking low-level optimization tool from AMD. It provides detailed timing information on Radeon Graphics using custom, built-in, hardware thread-tracing, allowing the developer deep inspection of GPU workloads.

This unique tool generates easy to understand visualizations of how your DirectX®12 and Vulkan® games interact with the GPU at the hardware level. Profiling a game is both a quick, and simple process using the Radeon Developer Panel and the public display driver.

In order to use the latest features of RGP, it is strongly recommended that users update to the latest driver.


## Getting Started

1. Install the latest AMD Video/display driver.
