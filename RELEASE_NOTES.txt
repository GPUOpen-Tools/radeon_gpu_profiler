Known Issues
---------------------------

* All platforms

1) When using RGP with RenderDoc, please make sure that RenderDoc is terminated between RenderDoc capture sessions (generating a RenderDoc capture file or loading a RenderDoc capture file is considered a session for the purpose here). While it is possible to take multiple RGP profiles of a RenderDoc capture file, it is not possible to take RGP profiles between RenderDoc sessions. If this is attempted, RenderDoc will show an error dialog box indicating that an RGP profile can't be taken and to restart RenderDoc.
2) If an instance of Radeon GPU Profiler is spawned from RenderDoc, it must be closed before restarting RenderDoc. The menu option to create new RGP profiles will not be enabled otherwise.
3) OpenCL™ captures may include an extra DMA command buffer in the Profile summary.
4) It is recommended to use at least 1080p display resolution (1920 x 1080) with the RGP user interface. Some minor user interface issues may appear when using a lower resolution.

* Windows®

1) Some Radeon Software hotkeys may conflict with Radeon GPU Profiler shortcut keys. The Radeon Software hotkeys can be reconfigured by opening the Radeon Software panel (from the system tray), selecting the Hotkeys tab under Settings then changing or unbinding any conflicting hotkeys.
2) If a DirectX 12 profile is missing GPU synchronization primitive data (i.e. signals and waits) on the Frame summary pane, please try running the included scripts\AddUserToGroup.bat batch file and then recapturing the profile. This batch file must be run as Administrator.
3) The Driver information will not be displayed in the System information page for profiles from HIP or OpenCL applications.
4) When using a 24.30-based driver, the L2 cache size reported in the System information page on RX 9000 Series GPUs will be incorrect for profiles from HIP or OpenCL applications.

* Linux®

1) With the introduction of 25.20-based Linux drivers, the AMDVLK driver is no longer included in the amdgpu-pro driver package. This is a result of the AMDVLK open-source project being discontinued as mentioned here (https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/discussions/416). Instead, the RADV open-source Vulkan® driver is installed by default. Consequently, the Radeon Developer Panel does not support capturing data from Vulkan applications when using these newer driver releases. To analyze Linux Vulkan workloads with Radeon GPU Profiler (RGP), Radeon Raytracing Analyzer (RRA), or Radeon Memory Visualizer (RMV), users can opt for a 25.10-based driver. Alternatively, analysis can be performed using the data capture mechanism integrated within the RADV driver, although this method is not supported by the Radeon Developer Panel. For more information on configuring RADV, refer to the environment variable documentation, specifically the MESA_VK_TRACE_* environment variables (https://docs.mesa3d.org/envvars.html#envvar-MESA_VK_TRACE) which can be utilized for enabling and configuring tracing.
2) When using a 25.10-based driver or older: Installations of Ubuntu 20.04 or newer may have the RADV open source Vulkan driver installed by default on the system. As a result, after an amdgpu-pro driver install, the default Vulkan ICD may be the RADV ICD. In order to capture a profile, Vulkan applications must be using the amdgpu-pro Vulkan ICD. The default Vulkan ICD can be overridden by setting the following environment variable before launching a Vulkan application: VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/etc/vulkan/icd.d/amd_icd64.json.

* RDNA

1) The Device configuration does not show the correct Work group processor per Shader engine for certain parts with disabled CUs.

* Radeon Developer Panel

1) See RDP_RELEASE_NOTES.txt for additional items that may affect profiling.
