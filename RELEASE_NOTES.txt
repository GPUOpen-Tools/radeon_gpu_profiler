Radeon™ GPU Profiler V2.2 07-01-2024
-------------------------------------

V2.2 Changes
-------------------------------------

1) Updated to use Qt 6.7.0
2) Fix a crash when loading a RADV-exported profile (https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/radeon_gpu_profiler/issues/98)
3) Enabling shader instrumentation (to support showing thread divergence in the ray tracing shader table UI) for Vulkan® is now supported starting with 24.10-based drivers
4) Reduced profile load time for certain profiles, especially for those captured on RDNA™ 3 hardware
5) Bug/stability fixes

Known Issues
-------------------------------------

* All platforms

1)  When using RGP with RenderDoc, please make sure that RenderDoc is terminated between RenderDoc capture sessions (generating a RenderDoc capture file or loading a RenderDoc capture file is considered a session for the purpose here). While it is possible to take multiple RGP profiles of a RenderDoc capture file, it is not possible to take RGP profiles between RenderDoc sessions. If this is attempted, RenderDoc will show an error dialog box indicating that an RGP profile can't be taken and to restart RenderDoc
2)  If an instance of Radeon GPU Profiler is spawned from RenderDoc, it must be closed before restarting RenderDoc. The menu option to create new RGP profiles will not be enabled otherwise.
3)  OpenCL™ captures may include an extra DMA command buffer in the Profile summary.
4)  It is recommended to use at least 1080p display resolution (1920 x 1080) with the RGP user interface. Some minor user interface issues may appear when using a lower resolution.

* Windows®

1)  D3D12 command list calls of ExecuteIndirect() may show in RGP as multiple compute events.
2)  Some Radeon Software hotkeys may conflict with Radeon GPU Profiler shortcut keys. The Radeon Software hotkeys can be reconfigured by opening the Radeon Software panel (from the system tray), selecting the Hotkeys tab under Settings then changing or unbinding any conflicting hotkeys.
3)  If a DirectX® 12 profile is missing GPU synchronization primitive data (i.e. signals and waits) on the Frame summary pane, please try running the included scripts\AddUserToGroup.bat batch file and then recapturing the profile. This batch file must be run as Administrator.

* Linux®

1)  Installations of Ubuntu 20.04 or newer may have the RADV open source Vulkan driver installed by default on the system. As a result, after an amdgpu-pro driver install, the default Vulkan ICD may be the RADV ICD. In order to capture a profile, Vulkan applications must be using the amdgpu-pro Vulkan ICD. The default Vulkan ICD can be overridden by setting the following environment variable before launching a Vulkan application: VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/etc/vulkan/icd.d/amd_icd64.json

* RDNA

1)  The Device configuration does not show the correct Work group processor per Shader engine for certain parts with harvested CUs.

* Radeon Developer Panel

1) See RDP_RELEASE_NOTES.txt for additional items that may affect profiling.
